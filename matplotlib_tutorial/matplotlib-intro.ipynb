    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "Matplotlib contains two main modules: pylab and pyplot. Pylab combines pyplot with numpy in the same namespace, which is more convenient, but its use has been discouraged. If you don't understand what a namespace is, you don't need to worry about it. For this course, we are going to import the pyplot and numpy modules separately, and this is the approach I recommend that you use when writing short python scripts to visualise your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a backend\n",
    "\n",
    "One complexity I would like to avoid is the choice of backends. Matplotlib can be used in many ways, e.g. you can write a python script that you run on the shell to generate a pdf, or you may only use matplotlib with Jupyter notebooks and draw inline plots. Depending on how it is used, users can choose a different backend to best suit the use case. You can read more about this [on the official documentation](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#backends).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we are going to use nbAgg backend, which is an interactive backend. An interactive backend allows you to interact with the resulting plot (zoom in and pan). It also means you can keep on modifying the image once it is drawn (it will be made clear later). Unfortunately I cannot seem to get the download button to work on Jupyter. To save the image, you will need to call \n",
    "```\n",
    "plot.savefig('filename.png')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you need to turn on interactive mode for the frontend. By default it should already be turned on, but we will enable it anyway just in case it wasn't. In interactive mode as soon as you call `plt.plot()` to draw a diagram, the resulting image will be displayed right away. In non-interactive mode, you need to call `plt.show()` as well. If you want to know the use case for non-interactive mode, have a read [on what the interactive mode is](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#what-is-interactive-mode).\n",
